# Semaps - A semantic approach to maps üåç

This is a student project, done during the HWS18 at the University of
Mannheim. Semaps fetches different datasets of the semantic web and
looks for common places in cities. So you can find what is important
for your next city trip! Of course, we're using the beautiful Mannheim
as a starting point!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

`npm start` runs the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) You will also see any lint errors in the console. <br>
`npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Deployment is done automatically with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) under [semaps.herokuapp.com](http://semaps.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Used Libraries

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for bootstrapping. <br>
[react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for working with maps. <br>
[axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for http requests.
